# Next Level Week : Ecoleta
A web app to register selective garbage area points and a mobile app  to check the nearest points and contact them. Both app uses geographic location to register and check garbage points.

## About the course
This was one-week free course to programmers with mid or high experience with Javascript and SQL. 
The main focus of the course was to delivery an application capable of simple register operations to highlight the advantages of Typescript, using React, React Native and Expo.

## Challenging myself
Instead of implementing the mobile app with a search at Home page using input box, I have used the IBGE API (used as well in the web application) to fetch a list of cities based on the selected state.

## Final thoughts
I loved the project. It was the first time that I've developed with Typescript and it was my third mobile app. The final class, teaching how to use Drag'nDrop, for example, it was very helpful, and much easier than I thought it would be. Great to update my own knowledge.
And about my own challenge, I don't have too much experience with mobile app design neither React Native, but I'm proud that I could put a simple select box fetching data from external API on my own.
